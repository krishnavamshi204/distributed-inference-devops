Distributed Inference Infrastructure on AWS
Overview

This project demonstrates the setup and deployment of a Distributed Inference Infrastructure using Terraform, AWS EC2, Python workers, and Linux environments.

The assignment focuses on:

Infrastructure provisioning using Terraform
Worker-based distributed inference architecture
AWS EC2 deployment
Linux environment setup
Python dependency management
Infrastructure troubleshooting and debugging

##The infrastructure consists of:

API Server
Caller Worker
Inference Worker

All infrastructure resources were provisioned and managed using Terraform.

##Challenges Faced:
III SDK / Module Integration Issue

One of the major blockers during the assignment was the integration of the iii SDK required by the inference worker.

While running the worker:

python inference_worker.py

Encountered:

ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'iii'
Investigation Performed

To troubleshoot the issue:

Verified requirements.txt
Explored repository structure
Checked worker manifest configuration (iii.worker.yaml)
Searched for SDK installation references in the repository
Attempted package installation using pip

Commands used:

pip install iii-sdk
find . -name "_iii_"
cat iii.worker.yaml
Root Cause Analysis

The repository mainly provided:

worker templates
configuration manifests
infrastructure setup

However, the actual iii SDK package was not publicly available through PyPI during implementation.

This caused:

ERROR: No matching distribution found for iii-sdk
Learning Outcome

This issue provided practical exposure to:

dependency troubleshooting
SDK verification workflows
package management debugging
infrastructure-level investigation
real-world DevOps debugging practices

It also highlighted the importance of:

dependency documentation
package availability validation
reproducible environment setup
Current Status

Infrastructure provisioning and worker environment setup were completed successfully.

The remaining limitation was external SDK availability required for complete runtime execution.
